        The French %{link_speedcubing} association (AFS) is a 1901 law
        association, bringing together volunteers and passionate members around
        the practice of rotating puzzles, whose cube invented by Ernö Rubik is
        the most famous representative.

        Its purpose is to promote the discipline, notably by facilitating the
        organization on the French territory of %{link_competitions} (governed
        by the World Cube Association). As such, we support the organizers in
        various ways (loan of equipment, assistance to finance rooms, insurance,
        management of registration fees, etc.). We also regularly intervene in
        the framework of %{link_animations} (cultural, associative, charitable,
        commercial, media) by offering demonstrations and initiations.

      of rotating puzzles, derived from the famous Rubik’s cube. Speedcubing is

        You have found a competition to compete in! But what to do now? This
        text will give you some answers and hopefully allow you to make the most
        of this experience. All competitions are different, so here you will

        The %{link_wca} is the body that regulates speedcubing competitions,
        similar to FIBA for basketball. The %{link_regulations} lists all rules
        that must be followed by competitors in a competition. It is not
        necessary to know all the rules by heart, but having read the rules will
        undoubtedly be of great help.

        The competitions offer a registration procedure on their page, directly
        on the WCA website. By registering, you allow the organizing team to
        know in advance how many people will participate and in which events, in
        order to better prepare the competition. Register as soon as you are
        sure to participate, do not wait until the last minute. In addition,
        registering early allows you to be contacted if necessary (for example
        in case of change in the course of the competition). If you want to
        change your registration, simply contact the organizing team and ask to
        make the changes.

        People arriving for the first time in competition are often stressed, so
        do not hesitate to train a little while solving cubes in front of
        friends or family, or even in public, on the train or elsewhere! You may
        still be stressed, but don’t worry, everyone has been there! Relax, and
        try to make times that are right for you.

        If your stickers come off slightly, you probably don’t need to replace

        them! A little lube never hurts either. The cubes you bring with you
        must not be electronic or have more than one logo (no logo for
        blindfolded events).

        attempts, you can spend time with other cubers, learn some tricks, see
        some wacky cubes and watch the other speedcubers. Make sure you have a
        place to eat lunch! Some competitions provide meals, while others can
        simply take a break and let participants manage their lunch. Find out
        what the competition has to offer, and plan to have cash if necessary!

        During a round, you will have to solve your puzzle 5 times (3 times for
        some puzzles)! Once a puzzle has been solved, wait before being called
        again. Leave your cube to the judge so that it can be scrambled again
        for your next attempt. In the case of a combined final, the organizers
        set a time limit to be reached in 1 or 2 attempts, giving the right to 3
        or 5 attempts. If your time has not been less than that, you will not be
        able to do all the attempts. Your times will still be added to the WCA
        database, but you will not be able to get an average of 5.

        People often worry about being a judge because they think that means
        they won’t be able to compete. But that is completely false! Most of the
        time, a round is divided into groups, so you can be a judge in a group
        other than your own, or during an event in which you do not participate.

        There are two systems mainly used in competitions. In the first, the
        judge picks up a cube at the scrambling table and then picks up the
        competitor in the waiting zone. In the second the judge sits at a table,
        and “runners” go back and forth between the scrambling table and the
        competitor tables. In this case, the judges stay at their table. This
        second system is used most of the time in French competitions.

        Before inspection, the judge will ask you, “Ready? ”. Answer “OK”, “Yes”
        or nod and the judge will remove the cube cover. Take the puzzle and
        look at it as you wish. Do not apply moves on the puzzle or your attempt
        will be disqualified! The judge will say two things during this
        inspection. At 8 seconds, he will say “8”. At 12 seconds, he will say
        “12”. When you hear “12”, you should start your timer as soon as
        possible to avoid having a penalty!

        At this point, do not touch your cube or the timer. A judge will check
        the state of your cube, and record the time on the scorecard. You will
        then have to sign the scorecard. Only sign if you agree with the judge’s
        time. In case of disagreement, call a Delegate.

    #original_hash: 5c798bb
    p1: >-
      You can send, correct, or delete your results while the competition is
      ongoing. Times must be entered without period, colon or comma, software
      will do the rest. For example:
    #original_hash: 103ec05
    ex1: '2 seconds 54 hundredths: enter "254"'
    #original_hash: f4a8beb
    ex2: '1 minute 23 seconds 12 hundredths: enter "12312"'
    #original_hash: cfcd698
    cents: 'Warning: never forget hundredths!'
    #original_hash: 5d985db
    penalties: 'Penalties:'
    #original_hash: f2a53f0
    pen1: >-
      If you get a +2, directly enter the final result. For example: if you
      finished in 6 seconds 45, with a +2 penalty, enter directly 8 seconds 45
      as "845".
    #original_hash: 63c3ba7
    pen2: >-
      In you get a DNF, enter "D" in the field. If you get a DNS, enter "S" in
      the field.
    #original_hash: 2afd2da
    multihelp: >-
      For multiblind, first field is the number of solved cubes, second one is
      the number of attempted cubes, last one is the time (in minutes, seconds
      and hundredths).
    #original_hash: 486578b
    multiex: >-
      For example: 5/7 in 47 minutes 12 seconds: enter 5 in the first field, 7
      in the second one, and "471200" in the last one.
